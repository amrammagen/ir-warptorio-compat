# Compatibility mod for IR3 and Warptorio 2

This mod does the following:

- Fix compatibility errors when running the two mods so that the game will actually start.
- Move the prerequisites for warptorio researches around so they're available in roughly the same spots as base warptorio. However, the initial unlock of teleporters (red -> green), harvesters (red -> early green) and the boiler (red -> late green) are slightly later than in base warptorio.
- Add damage bonuses in warp bullet techs to shotgun turrets
- Add a chance to spawn steam fissures in the starting area
- Fix gem spawning (only on resource-specific planets)
- Reduce smelting times for crushed/pure metal ores to counteract area impact of adding crushing/washing processes
- Add chrome-tier chests with larger capacity than steel chests

This mod is not compatible with Warptorio Expansion because many things in the expansion are hardcoded for vanilla.
