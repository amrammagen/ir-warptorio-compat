# Compatibility mod for IR3 and Warptorio 2

** Warning: I have not playtested this. Any balance feedback would be appreciated. **

This mod fixes compatibility errors when running the two mods so that the game will actually start. 
It also adds some obvious balance changes: 

- Move harvester 1 to from blue science to early green (vs late red in base warptorio)
- Add damage bonuses in warp bullet techs to shotgun turrets


This mod is not compatible with Warptorio Expansion because many things in the expansion are hardcoded for vanilla.
